Web Technology project
======================

In this project we validate the claims made in the article 'A
framework to balance privacy and data usability using data
degradation' by Van Heerde et al.

Starting out
------------

1. Install GIT (http://git-scm.com/download)

2. Go the the directory where you want to add the project directory.

3. Clone the GIT repo to the directory:

git clone git@github.com:kpuputti/dbtech.git

which creates a dbtech folder with the project content inside.

Workflow
--------

- Always when you start out, pull the latest changes from the
  upstream:

git pull origin master

- Make your changes.

- See the diffs of your changes:

git diff

- Add your changes to be committed:

git add file1 file2

- Commit your changes:

git commit -m "commit message"

- Every once in a while, push your changes to the upstream:

git push origin master

- You can always see the status of your local repo by running:

git status

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is written using LaTeX. You can compile the .tex files
by going to the corresponding directory and running:

make

which creates some extra files as well as the pdf file. You can clean
the extra files created by LaTeX by running:

make clean
